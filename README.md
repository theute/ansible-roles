# Overview

This repository constains a basic WildFly ansible role for starting and
stopping WildFly and for generating a JDR report.

Example [playbook](wildfly-playbook.yml) and [inventory](wildfly-inventory)
files are provided. The provided example playbook starts a server, generates
the JDR report and stops the server. 

To test, install Wildfly in /tmp/wildfly then execute the following command:
`ansible-playbook wildfly-playbook.yml -i wildfly-inventory`

Available role variables are listed in [inventory](wildfly-inventory) file.
Default values can be seen at the [defaults
file](roles/wildfly/defaults/main.yml). There are some other variables listed,
but should be considered as private variables.

In the provided [playbook sample](wildfly-playbook.yml), the JDR report may
fail to generate because WildFly may haven't booted up complety by the time the
request is sent.
